# Introduction-to-UNIX

*What is Operating System?
=> 1. An operating system is a set of programs which acts an interface between users and computer hardware.
   2. It is the heart of any machine software and provides an environment in which a user can execute programs.
   3. In other words, it is a low level software which manages hardware by controlling the execution of all kind of programs.
   4. It controls the allocation of resources and services such as memory, processors, devices, information and so on.
   5. It supports computer basic functions such as scheduling tasks, controlling peripherals and so on.
   6. Most used OS are DOS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and UNIX/Linux.

*Important functions of Operating System:
=>1. Memory management
  2. Processor management
  3. Device management 
  4. File management
  5. Security
  6. Control over System performance
  7. Job scheduling
  8. Error detecting
  9. Co-oradination between users and other softwares

*What is UNIX?
=> 1. UNIX is a multi-user,multi-tasking and multi processing operating system.
   2. It is a command line interpreter.
   3. Developed in AT&T Bell Laboratories Research center, USA in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Denis Ritchie.
   4. Earlier UNIX was written in assembly language and originally spelled as UNICS.
   5. Later it was re-written in C language and named as UNIX.
   6. UNIX is not a open source OS.

*Features of UNIX
=> 1. Multi-user: More than one user can use the machine simultaneously supported via terminals.
   2. Multi-tasking: Multiple programs can be run at a time. (ex. image processing, sort the file)
   3. Multi-process: Each user can execute several processes simultaneously.
   4. Hierarchical structure: UNIX directories are present like a tree structure to support the organization and maintenance of files.
   5. Programming facility: UNIX shell can be used as a Programming/Scripting language.
   6. Portability: It is the ability of the software that operates from one machine to another machine having different configuration. UNIX allows user to transfer data from one system to another.
   7. Security: Unix has a sytem level security controlled by system administrator and file level security controlled by owner of the file.
   8. Tools and Utilities: Supports many of the tools, libraries and utilities to aid software development.
   9. Piping: In piping concept, output of the first command becomes the input of the next command/process.
   10. Modularity: UNIX consists of multiple number of independent modules or programs which performs different elementary tasks.
   11. Help facility: IN UNIX, "man" command is used to view help content on any command.
